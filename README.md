# Cryptocurrencies

## Purpose
The purpose of the project was to run an unsupervised learning model on crptocurrency data for Accountability Accounting. We ran this analysis to help the business determine which cryptocurrencies are on the trading market and how they could be grouped to create a classification system for this new investment.
